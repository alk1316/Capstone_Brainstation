  # Inventory Analysis Capstone Project
### Analysis to Predict Demand and Inventory Levels

  </a>


</div>

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the manufacturing company's inventory to identify patterns and areas for improvement. Techniques will be applied to model demand and optimize inventory levels.

The specific solutions include:

 - Demand Modeling: Forecasting demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory.

 - Inventory Optimization: Implementing optimization strategies such as EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) and ABC analysis to efficiently manage inventory.

<h2 id="motivation"> Project Motivation </h2>
As a SAP Business One consultant with over a decade of experience, I have observed a recurring challenge in every company where I have implemented this powerful ERP: managing inventory levels. 

During each new implementation, it's common for upper management to ask if the system can automatically calculate optimal stock levels based on existing information. Unfortunately, the answer has always been a resounding "No". And few companies choose to invest in this analysis; many continue to operate intuitively, without using the existing data as a guide for decision-making. 

This challenge has been a constant throughout my career and is what motivates me to tackle this project. I want to explore how, through data analysis, we can obtain accurate demand predictions and, consequently, determine optimal inventory levels. With a robust ERP like SAP Business One, companies already have access to a rich source of data, but implementing the system is only the first step. It's crucial to take an additional step: analyzing that data to transform information into real value for the company's operations.

My goal with this project is to finally answer the question I've heard countless times: "How do I calculate the demand and stock levels for my company?" I hope that the results of this analysis not only provide a clear and practical answer but also become a valuable tool for many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), helping them optimize their operations and reduce costs.


<h2 id="opportunity"> The opportunity </h2>
Technological advancements have revolutionized the way companies access, analyze, and apply data. Today, data analysis and the implementation of machine learning models not only enable more informed decision-making but also provide a crucial competitive advantage.

In todayâ€™s business environment, where data is stored across multiple systems like ERP, WMS, and CRM, its analysis is not just desirable but essential for successful management. This is where a significant opportunity arises: leveraging the vast amount of data stored in business systems to apply models that provide a deeper understanding of the market and greater capacity to meet its demands.

By thoroughly analyzing business data and applying machine learning models, companies can improve demand forecasting, identify hidden sales patterns, and optimize their operations. This not only leads to more efficient inventory management, ensuring product availability when needed, but also contributes to the reduction of operational costs by minimizing excess stock and preventing stockouts. In summary, integrating advanced analytics and machine learning into business management opens the door to greater efficiency, agility, and profitability.

<h2 id="keytakeaway"> Key takeaways </h2>
Data Analysis: Analysis of supply and demand, best-selling products, inventory turnover, among others.

Demand Modeling: Predicting product demand to better plan inventory needs.

By applying inventory analysis, organizations can respond quickly to shifts in demand, enabling more agile and effective interventions.
